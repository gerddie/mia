   @ingroup test
   \brief test if two images are equal and report the results by using BOOST_TEST methods.

   Test if two images are ove equal size, equal pixel type and if their
   pixel values are equal if the pixel type is integral, or close
   if the pixel type is floating point.
   The backend uses the BOOST unit test library to report sucess or failture.
