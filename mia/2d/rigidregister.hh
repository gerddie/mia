/**
   \ingroup registration

   @brief Linear Registration of 2D images.

   Class for registration without regularization - i.e. should only be used
   for affine, rigid and translation only registrations.
   However, one might note that the generic implementation of the C2DTransformtion
   class makes is possible to use any kind of transformation that is provided by
   a transformation plug-in.
   This class allows that exactly one cost function is used.
