   \ingroup logging
   \brief base class to redirect output streams

   This class implements the abstract base class for stream output redirection
   to e.g. a text window or a console.
   The specialization must implement the do_put_buffer method, which writes out
   the characters from \a begin to \a end using a function of the output device.
