   \brief A wrapper for the \a cstdio file type that closes the file  automatically when
   the scope is left.

   This class implements a transparent wrapper around the C stdio FILE type to make it
   possible that the file is closed autmatically when the scope of the file variable is left.
   A variable of this type can be used with all the C-stdio functions that take a file
   pointer as argument.
