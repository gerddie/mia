   @ingroup perf
   \brief A class to evaluate image similarity profiles of image series
   \tparam dim the dimenstion of the image data to be used

   This class evaluates the similarity profile of a series of images
   with respect to a certain cost function and a given reference.
   It can then be used to evaluate a periodic subset and the
   highest frequency coefficient.
