/** \mainpage MIA - plug-in based framework for gray-scale and medical image processing 
 
  \section intro_sec Introduction
  
  The MIA provides a framwork for common tasks in gray scale images processing 
  including image filtering and image registration for 2D and 3D images. 
  This is the documentation of the public interface of the according libraries.

  In addition to this library interface there exist a number of plug-ins and 
  programs make use if the interface and can be run to execute certain 
  image processing tasks.
  For information about these programs and plug-ins please see the user guide 
  at https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mia/index.php?title=Mia_-_A_tool_chain_for_Medical_Image_Analysis

  \section naming_sec About naming schemes

  The following naming scheme is employed for most of the classes and data structurs: 
  
  Names for template classes that provide interfaces start with a capital "T" e.g. TShape, or TFactory.
  Names of classes start with a capital "C" like CSegSet, or CSplineKernel. 
  Classes and structures that work as functors are mamed starting with a capital "F", e.g. FMeanValue. 
  Names of Plain old data structures begin with a "S". 


/** 
    \defgroup infrastructure Infrastructure 
    These classes and functions are related to the infrastructure provided by the MIA libraies. 
    This includes the menas for plug-in handling, option parsing, and logging.

    \defgroup filtering Filtering

    These classes and functions are related to image filtering.  

    \defgroup interpol Interpolation 

    

    \defgroup classes Classes that provide primary funcionality 
    \defgroup templates Templates that provide primary funcionality 
    \defgroup functors Functors
    \defgroup helpers Helper classes and functions 
    \defgroup traits Template metaprogramming classes
    \defgroup tests Classes used for tests only
