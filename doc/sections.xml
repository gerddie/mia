<section name="Filtering of series of 2D images in a 3D fashion (out-of-core)">
  <description>
    The programs in this section are dedicated to processing series of 2D images in a 3D fashion out-of-core. 
    This is intended for large images that would not fit into the main memory if processing was to be done 
    as a true 3D images. 
    As a result, only spacial, non-iterative filters are supported.

<section name="Image conversion">
  <description>
    The programs in this section are used to convert beteeen the supported image file formats, to combine 
    2D images to a 3D representation, or to extract 2D slices from 3D images.
    Note, that for the conversion between pixel formats the programs <link key="Sec">mia-2dimagefilter</link>, and 
    <link key="Sec">mia-3dimagefilter</link>,
    in conjunction with the corresponding plug-in 
    <link key="pluginconvert">2dimage/filter</link>, respective 
    <link key="pluginconvert">3dimage/filter</link> have to be used.

<section name="Registration of series of 2D images">
  <description>
    These programs are mostly tailored for the use of motion compensation in series of myocardial perfusion images and are thought to 
    be used in conjunction with the tools for analyis of image series in the section 
    <link key="Sec">Tools for Myocardial Perfusion Analysis</link>.
