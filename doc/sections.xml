  <section name="Filtering of series of 2D images in a 3D fashion (out-of-core)">
    <text>
      The programs in this section are dedicated to processing series of 2D images in a 3D fashion out-of-core. 
      This is intended for large images that would not fit into the main memory if processing was to be done 
      as a true 3D images. 
      As a result, only spacial, non-iterative filters are supported.

  <section name="Image conversion">
    <text>
      The programs in this section are used to convert bewteen the supported image file formats, to combine 
      2D images to a 3D representation extract 2D slices from 3D images.
      Note, that for the conversion between pixel formats the programs <link>mia-2dimagefilter</link>, and 
      <link>mia-3dimagefilter<link>,
      in conjunction with the corresponding 
      <link>convert:2dimage/filter</link> and 
      <link>convert:3dimage/filter<link> have to be used.
