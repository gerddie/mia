<section name="Image conversion">
  <description>
    The programs in this section are used to convert beteeen the supported image file formats, to combine 
    2D images to a 3D representation, or to extract 2D slices from 3D images.
    Note, that for the conversion between pixel formats the programs <link key="Sec">mia-2dimagefilter</link>, and 
    <link key="Sec">mia-3dimagefilter</link>,
    in conjunction with the corresponding plug-in 
    <link key="pluginconvert">2dimage/filter</link>, respective 
    <link key="pluginconvert">3dimage/filter</link> have to be used.

<section name="Analysis, filtering, combining, and segmentation of 2D images">
  <description>The programs in this section are dedicated to basic 2D image processing tasks, like filtering by invoking 
  plug-ins (<link key="SecPlugintype">2dimage/filter</link>), 
  combining pairs of images (<link key="SecPlugintype">2dimage/combiner</link>), 
  creating test images (<link key="SecPlugintype">2dimage/creator</link>), and evaluating some statistics.

<section name="Registration, Comparison, and Transformation of 2D images">
  <description>
    The programs in this section relate to the alignment, transformation and comparison of pairs of 2D images.

<section name="Registration of series of 2D images">
  <description>
    These programs are mostly tailored for the use of motion compensation in series of myocardial perfusion 
    images and are thought to be used in conjunction with the tools for analyis of image series in the section 
    <link key="Sec">Tools for Myocardial Perfusion Analysis</link>.

  <description>
    These programs provide various means to evaluate statistics and comparisons for series of images that stem from 
    myocardial perfusion imaging.

<section name="Processing of series of 2D images in a 3D fashion (out-of-core)">
  <description>
    The programs in this section are dedicated to processing series of 2D images in a 3D fashion out-of-core. 
    This is intended for large images that would not fit into the main memory if processing was to be done 
    as a true 3D images. 
    As a result, only spacial, non-iterative operators are supported.
