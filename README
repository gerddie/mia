Specifics about using MIA with matlab on GCC compiled systems: 

To use MIA with MatLab, it needs to be compiled with the same C++ ABI 
  version Matlab was compiled with. 
Specificall, MIA and BOOST should link to the very same version of libstdc++.
In case of MatLab 7.1 this is libstdc++.so.5. 
One also should remove the libraries libstdc++.so.* and libgcc_s.so.*  that are provided 
by MatLab and use the system wide ones - these libraries usually reside in 
<MatLab-ROOT>/sys/os/<YourOS>/
